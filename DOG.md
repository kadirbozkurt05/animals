Dogs are domesticated mammals, closely related to wolves, that have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, working abilities, and physical characteristics. They are often kept as pets or working animals (such as shepherds, hunters, and retrievers), and are either classified as working dogs, herding dogs, hunting dogs, or companion dogs.

Dogs are social animals that form strong bonds with their owners and other dogs. They are intelligent and trainable, and can be taught a variety of tasks. Dogs are also very playful animals and enjoy activities such as fetch, tug-of-war, and hide-and-seek.

Dogs are carnivores and their diet consists mainly of meat. They are also known to eat bones, which help them to digest their food. Dogs are very clean animals and they spend a lot of time grooming themselves. They have a rough tongue that helps them to remove dirt and parasites from their fur.

Dogs are also very vocal animals and they use a variety of barks, whines, and growls to communicate with each other. They also use their tails to communicate, with a wagging tail indicating happiness and a stiff tail indicating annoyance.

Dogs are generally pack animals and they thrive on companionship. They can be very loyal and loving pets, and they make great companions for people of all ages.
